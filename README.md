# SQL Server Samples Repository
This GitHub repository contains code samples that demonstrate how to use Microsoft's SQL products including SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, and Azure SQL Data Warehouse. Each sample includes a README file that explains how to run and use the sample.

Note that certain features like In-Memory OLTP are edition specific for SQL Server and would be possible to implement if the edition which supports that feature is being used to run the sample.
